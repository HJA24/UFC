    \section*{Lightweight}
    The \textit{Lightweight}-tier consists of predictions on core fight outcomes, including projected winner, method of victory and key performance metrics.
    It serves as a foundational tool for bettors who operate in standard markets.
    Within the \textit{lightweight}-tier the following events are modelled:

    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{blue} wins
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{red} wins by a knockout
        \item[--] The expected number of significant strikes landed by \textit{blue}
        \item[--] The expected number of seconds in ground control of \textit{blue}
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Middleweight}
    The \textit{Middleweight}-tier provides access to detailed fight predictions about the duration of the fight and round-by-round outcomes.
    It is intended for advanced bettors active in derivative and prop markets.
    The following estimates are within its scope:

    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{blue} wins in round 1
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{red} wins by a knockout in round 3
        \item[--] The probability that the fight lasts more than 1.5 rounds
        \item[--] The probability that the fight goes to the distance
    \end{itemize}

    \section*{Heavyweight}
    The \textit{Heavyweight}-tier offers the most advanced level of inference, including judge-specific scoring and statistical dependencies between all performance metrics.
    It is intended for professional bettors that seek the finest granular insights.
    Examples of such insights are:

     \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{blue} has more significant strikes landed than \textit{red}
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{red} wins by a knockout in the first minute
        \item[--] The probability that \textit{blue} wins by unanimous decision
        \item[--] The probability that judge \textit{Sal D'Amato} assign a score of $10-7$ to a round
        \item[--] The correlation between the number of attempted takedowns and the number of submission attempts of \textit{blue}
    \end{itemize}
