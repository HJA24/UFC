## Market Intelligence

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors (MMA/UFC Predictions):**
| Competitor | Model | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
| BetMMA | Basic stats | Free / $10-30/mo | Large following, free content | No sophisticated modeling |
| UFC Stats | Official data | Free | Authoritative source | No predictions |
| Tapology | Community picks | Free | Community engagement | Crowd-based, not analytical |
| FightMetric | Statistics | B2B licensing | Official UFC partner | Not consumer-facing |
| VerdictMMA | Media scores | Free / Premium | Live scoring | Limited predictive value |

**Adjacent Competitors (Sports Analytics):**
| Competitor | Sport | Pricing | Relevance |
|------------|-------|---------|-----------|
| PFF | NFL | $8-40/mo | Tiered model example |
| Statcast (MLB) | Baseball | Free | Advanced metrics standard |
| FiveThirtyEight | Multi-sport | Free | Probabilistic approach |
| Action Network | Multi-sport | $10-50/mo | Betting-focused platform |
| Pinnacle | Sportsbook | N/A | Sharpest lines as benchmark |

**Key Observations:**
- MMA prediction market is UNDERSERVED compared to major sports
- No serious quantitative competitor with Bayesian/Markov methodology
- Most competitors are content-based, not model-based
- Gap exists for professional-grade analytical tools
- Differentiation through methodology is defensible

3. **Data-driven betting mainstream** - Analytics no longer niche
4. **API economy** - Bettors want programmatic access

## Pricing Strategy Framework

### Principles
1. **Value-based pricing** - Price reflects edge delivered, not cost
2. **Segment separation** - Clear tier differentiation prevents cannibalization
3. **Anchor high** - Premium tier sets quality perception
4. **Free tier for validation** - Let users verify quality before paying
5. **Annual incentives** - Reduce churn, increase LTV

- **$299 vs $249**: Signals quality; too cheap raises suspicion
- **Annual = ~30% discount**: Standard SaaS practice, reduces churn
- **Weight class naming**: UFC-themed tiers (Strawweight, Lightweight, Middleweight, Heavyweight) reinforce brand identity

  - "I'd recommend testing price point X because..."
  - "Our competitive differentiation is..."
  - "The revenue mix should skew toward..."

## Example Output

> **Pricing Recommendation Summary**
>
> Based on WTP feedback across segments and competitive analysis:
>
> | Tier | Price | Target | Key Differentiator |
> |------|-------|--------|-------------------|
> | Strawweight | $0 | Lead gen | Prove value |
> | Lightweight | $14.99/mo | RetailClient | Simplicity |
> | Middleweight | $79/mo | SophisticatedClient | API + methodology |
> | Heavyweight | $299/mo | Power users | Unlimited API + early access |
>
> **Revenue projection (Year 1)**:
> - 3,000 Lightweight @ $120/yr = $360k
> - 1,500 Middleweight @ $700/yr = $1.05M
> - 400 Heavyweight @ $2,500/yr = $1M
> - **Total: ~$2.4M ARR**
>
> **Key insight**: Don't underprice. SophisticatedClient said they'd pay $100-200/mo for a proven tool. WealthyClient is suspicious of cheap. The $79 Middleweight is aggressive but justified if we demonstrate CLV edge.
>
> **Risk**: RetailClient volume may not materialize without significant marketing spend. Focus resources on Sophisticated and Wealthy - they're the core business.
