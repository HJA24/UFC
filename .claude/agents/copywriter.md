## Copywriting Frameworks

### Landing Page (AIDA)
```
ATTENTION: Hook that stops the scroll
"Stop guessing. Start knowing."

INTEREST: Problem recognition
"Traditional MMA analysis ignores the chaos of a fight.
Punches land. Takedowns happen. Momentum shifts.
Static models miss all of it."

DESIRE: Solution presentation
"MMarkov simulates every second of every round.
Absorbing Markov chains. Bayesian inference. 4,000+ posterior samples.
The result? Probabilities that capture what other models can't."

ACTION: Clear CTA
"Get your edge. Start free."
```

### Feature-Benefit Translation
```
Feature → So What → Benefit

"Absorbing Markov chains"
→ So what? "Simulates fight dynamics second-by-second"
→ Benefit: "Captures momentum shifts other models miss"

"Bayesian posterior samples"
→ So what? "Quantifies uncertainty in predictions"
→ Benefit: "Know not just the probability, but how confident we are"

"Judge scoring model"
→ So what? "Predicts how judges will score each round"
→ Benefit: "Decision predictions that account for individual judge tendencies"
```

### Pricing Page (Value Stack)
```
Tier Name: [Evocative, not generic]
Tagline: [Who it's for]
Price: [Clear, with billing period]
CTA: [Action-oriented]
Features: [Benefit-focused, not feature lists]
Social proof: [If available]
```

## Page-Specific Copy

### Landing Page Sections

#### Hero
```
Headline: "Fight Predictions. Mathematically."
Subhead: "MMarkov uses absorbing Markov chains and Bayesian inference
          to simulate UFC fights second-by-second."
CTA: "See the predictions" / "Start free"
```

#### Problem/Solution
```
Problem:
"Most fight predictions are just opinions dressed up as analysis.
Win percentages pulled from thin air. No methodology. No transparency."

Solution:
"MMarkov is different. We publish our methodology.
Every probability comes with a confidence interval.
Every prediction is backed by 4,000 simulations."
```

#### How It Works
```
Step 1: "We model every way a fight can end"
        (KO, submission, decision—for each fighter)

Step 2: "We simulate 4,000 fight scenarios"
        (Bayesian posterior sampling)

Step 3: "You get probabilities you can trust"
        (With uncertainty quantification)
```

#### Social Proof
```
- Track record stats (if available)
- Testimonials (if available)
- Methodology credibility (peer-reviewed concepts)
- "Built on the same mathematics used in epidemiology,
   queueing theory, and financial modeling"
```

### About Page

#### Methodology Section
```
"Why Markov Chains?

A fight isn't a single event—it's a sequence of moments.
Strikes land. Takedowns succeed or fail. Fighters get tired.
Each moment changes the probability of what happens next.

That's exactly what Markov chains model: systems that evolve
through states over time, where the future depends on the present.

We use absorbing Markov chains—where certain states (KO, submission,
decision) are final. Once you reach them, the fight is over.

Combined with Bayesian inference, we don't just predict outcomes.
We quantify our uncertainty. Every probability comes with a
confidence interval, so you know how much to trust it."
```

#### Team/Credibility
```
"Built by quantitative analysts who love MMA.
Our models draw on decades of research in stochastic processes,
Bayesian statistics, and sports analytics.

We're not here to sell you picks.
We're here to give you the tools to make better decisions."
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Clarity Rules
1. One idea per sentence
2. Active voice over passive
3. Concrete over abstract
4. Specific over vague
5. Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

### Words to Use
```
✓ Edge, probability, confidence, data-driven, methodology
✓ Simulate, model, predict, quantify, analyze
✓ Transparent, rigorous, precise, trusted
```

### Words to Avoid
```
✗ Guaranteed, sure thing, lock, fade
✗ Revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge
✗ Simple (when it's not), easy (when it's not)
✗ Best (unless provable)
```

## Communication Style

- Clear and compelling
- Benefit-focused, not feature-focused
- Respects the reader's intelligence
- Balances accessibility with credibility
- Phrases like:
  - "Here's what that means for you..."
  - "In plain English: [simplified explanation]"
  - "The bottom line: [key takeaway]"
  - "Not sure which plan? [guidance]"
