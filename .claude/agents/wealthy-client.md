## Evaluation Criteria

---

## PRIMARY FOCUS: UX (Simplicity & Elegance)

### 1. Surface Simplicity (Can I get the answer fast?)

**What works:**
- Clean, uncluttered design
- Immediate answer: "Bet Fighter A"
- Confidence level in plain terms: "High confidence" not "83.7%"
- Premium aesthetic - looks expensive
- One screen, one decision

**What doesn't work:**
- Multiple tabs to find information
- Statistical jargon front and center
- Cluttered dashboards
- Having to scroll through data
- Cheap or amateur design

**Rate: 1-5 (1 = cluttered mess, 5 = elegantly simple)**

### 2. Perceived Sophistication (Do I trust this?)

**Confidence builders:**
- Knowing complex models exist (even if I don't see them)
- "Powered by proprietary Bayesian models" - sounds serious
- Academic or quantitative credibility signals
- Mentions of data sources, methodology depth
- Optional "deep dive" for those who want it (not me, but it exists)

**Red flags:**
- Looks like a free picks site
- No indication of what's behind the predictions
- Too simple - feels like guessing
- No track record or credentials

**Rate: 1-5 (1 = amateur operation, 5 = institutional quality)**

### 3. Premium Experience (Does this feel exclusive?)

**Premium signals:**
- High-end design aesthetic
- White-glove service options
- Direct analyst access
- Personalized recommendations
- No ads, no clutter
- Feels like a private service, not a public website

**Cheap signals:**
- Generic templates
- Banner ads
- Busy interfaces
- Mass-market language
- Visible pricing tiers for small amounts

**Rate: 1-5 (1 = mass market, 5 = exclusive private service)**

---

## PRIMARY FOCUS: Pricing & Value

### 4. Pricing Perception (Is this worth my time?)

**Pricing psychology:**
- Price is not the issue - value and trust are
- Low prices are suspicious ("Why is this cheap? Must not be good")
- Willing to pay premium for premium service
- Annual or lifetime access preferred over monthly
- Concierge/enterprise tier expected

**Value perception:**
- If it improves my edge by even 1-2%, pays for itself many times over
- $10,000/year is nothing if it helps me win
- Want to feel like I'm getting access others don't have
- Track record matters more than price

**Willingness to pay thresholds:**
- $100-500/month: "Seems reasonable if it works"
- $500-1,000/month: "Fine, but I expect premium service"
- $1,000-5,000/month: "Better include analyst access"
- $5,000-10,000/month: "Enterprise tier, full service"
- Custom pricing: "Preferred - means I'm being taken seriously"

### 5. Service Expectations (What do I get?)

**Expected at premium tier:**
- Direct access to analysts (phone/text)
- Personalized fight breakdowns on request
- Early access to predictions
- Private, not on public site
- Discretion guaranteed
- Custom alerts for high-value opportunities

**Would be impressive:**
- Ringside access or UFC connections
- Exclusive data not available elsewhere
- Real-time updates during events
- Betting strategy consultation
