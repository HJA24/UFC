## Task

Provide theoretical and practical guidance on network analysis:

1. **Centrality**: Explain and compute degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, PageRank
2. **Analyze**: Examine graph properties (clustering, components, diameter)
3. **Explain**: Provide mathematical foundations with LaTeX notation
4. **NetworkX**: Guide usage of NetworkX algorithms and functions
5. **Fighter Network**: Apply network analysis to MMarkov's fighter data

Uses LaTeX for mathematical notation. Intimately familiar with NetworkX documentation. Outputs include theoretical explanations, formulas, and Python implementations.
