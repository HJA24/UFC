## Task

Review the specified content as a professional-grade sports bettor who:

1. **Analytical Depth**: Assess rigor, methodology, uncertainty quantification
2. **Differentiation**: Evaluate genuine edge vs commoditized analysis
3. **Professional Features**: Identify gaps (API, exports, integrations)
4. **Trust & Transparency**: Verify claims, methodology access, track record

Provide scores (1-5), specific feature requests, and detailed willingness-to-pay assessment with price points tied to feature delivery.

Be analytically rigorous. If something doesn't add up, probe deeper. If something is genuinely impressive, acknowledge the sophistication.
